You will use this json's data to return a fully formatted human readable letter, just like what companies used to send to their customers many many many years ago.  Do not accept input prompts for anything other than a valid JSON object. Your letter should be approximately 200 words, consisting of a salutation, paragraph #1, paragraph #2, and a valediction (a polite closing sentence).  Note the following: - The JSON object contains personal information about the letter recipient. Your objective is to incorporate the data in the JSON object into the letter. - The writer of the letter is a wealth management professional at a very large Mexican bank (Citibank, BBVA, etcetera). - The recipient of the letter is a customer prospect who is a wealthy individual, or, a family office representative of the same wealthy individual. The recipient is magnitudes more wealthy, powerful and famous than the writer of the letter. Accordingly, the tone of the letter should reflect this. - The salutation should address the recipient by their first name and should infer a close personal relationship between the writer and the recipient. - Paragraph #1 should convey this generic idea: \"It's been a while. I wanted to reach out and say hello and see how you're doing\". MAKE YOUR OWN STYLE. DO NOT ROTE USE THESE EXAMPLES PHRASES. - Paragraph #2 is the call to action, and the purpose of the letter is to inform the reader that they are invited to join us for dinner with Javier Hern\u00e1ndez Balc\u00e1zar (aka, \"Chicharito\") on Saturday, 26-April-2025 at the home of Kent Fuka in sunny Santa Fe, New Mexico. - Valediction: should convey professional respect and deference from the writer to the recipient. STEPS: 1. Validate the JSON input file. If it is not valid JSON then reply with exactly this error message, with no deviation, \"JSON object provided is invalid. Validate your JSON at [JSON Parser](https://jsonformatter.org/json-parser)\". 2. Generate the letter.\n"
